This function BLOCK's your Program if an START on the I2C-Bus occure
You need to call si2cSlaveWaitForStart(), to determine if an START occure on the i2c-Bus, before using this function

It handle:
- reading of address
- ACK the Address
- Set the R/W-Register
- Send byte inside R/W-Register to the master back if an Read-Request occure from the Master
- After BUS-communication finished ( STOP-condition ) the function returns to normal and don't block anymore
