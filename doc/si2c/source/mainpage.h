# Software I2C-Slave library for AVR's Microcontroller

@author Martin Langlotz <stackshadow@evilbrain.de>

## About

This library provides an software-based i2c-slave library to communicate over the i2c-bis.

## Known working situations:

I2C-Master		| AVR		| MHz	| I2C-Speeds
----------------|-----------|-------|---------------|
RaspberryPi B	| Atmega 8	| 16Mhz | 9600Baud		|


## Configuration
Before you use the library, you need to setup it. \n
@link si2c_config See here on how to do that @endlink


@anchor si2c_register
## Register
The si2c-library predefine registers from where the Master can be read or write to. \n
You setuped the amount of aviable registers in @link si2c_config the configuration header @endlink \n
The slave handle read-write access to this registers automatically. \n

## Example
@link si2c_slave_example For an si2c-slave example, see here. @endlink

## Compile
You can use the provided codeblocks-project or just navigate in an terminal \n
to the directory where lib/si2c is placed and run:
make -f si2c.make Release

@todo Create Read-Only-Registers
@todo Create callback function if Register get changed or master try to read an specific register.
